## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Very simple and silly program that outputs theoretical length of a sheet of paper folded n times. The thikncess of paper and times folded is both inputed by user. I call it silly because a normal piece of paper with a thickness of 0.1mm cannot be physically folded more than 6 times (theoretically even 7). Made with C++ only as a way to get some practice.

## 💿 Working Principle <a name = "built_using"></a>

- Program asks user to input paper thickness
- Program asks user to input how many times he wants the paper to be folded
- Program calculates the thickness of the paper:
  - Creates a loop and multiplies the number by 2 each iteration
  - Converts the measurement unit to the correct one if
  - Outputs the thickness of the paper on each iteration
- Program outputs a final thickness of paper folded n times
